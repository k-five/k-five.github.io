to red-cursor.  
A simple, but still beautiful Terminal Emulator.  

<hr>


This is an app with pure `JavaScript`, `HTML` and `CSS`. It handles some essential keystrokes like:  
 - Tab completion  
 - Cursor movement  
   - Home  
   - End  
   - Left-arrow  
   - Right-arrow  
 - History Navigation  
   - Up-arrow  
   - Down-arrow  
 - Modify line  
   - Backspace  
   - Delete  
 - Special Key  
   - Alt  
   - Ctrl  
   - Shift  


### basic idea:  
I was looking for a good style for my personal website so that I can put my resume on it. And although  
there were a lot of good sites and especially free-templates and web-site-builder(s), eventually I came  
up with this idea that I should create an application; looks line my **terminal emulator** since almost  
I use `CLI` and not `GUI`  


### want to learn `span` tag deeply?  
Apart from designing it for myself, I tried to make it more useful for someone; who wants to learn `JS`  
and `CSS` and `HTML` deeply.  
The app is based on 3 core things:  
 1. `span` tag and `br` tag in HTML  
 2. **animation** in `CSS  
 3. **DOM** modification with JavaScript`  


### what is interesting with this app:  
The most interesting part of the app is **cursor movement** which is based on `animation` and asynchronous  
nature in `CSS`. Also modifying the **innerHTML** of a tag (= line) is a little tricky so that users can feel  
that they are encountered a real **Terminal Emulator** which in Linux it is usually down by **readlihne** library.  


### what it has for learners:  
 1. Full documentation on each step/line of the code.  
 2. Separate the main function (= main.js) form other parts so you can see how it works.  
 3. Key-binding to toggle `console.log` **on**/**off** so you easily can see what is going on.
